## Hi there 👋

I am Satish, a data analyst with extensive experience turning raw data into meaningful insights. I work across tools like SAS, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel to analyze data, build dashboards, and support data-driven decision making.

I’m highly curious by nature and continuously learning new skills to sharpen my analytical thinking.Data is not just my profession—it’s how I organize and improve my daily life. I rely heavily on Excel for personal finance tracking, travel planning, and structured study plans, reflecting my belief in practical, disciplined data usage.

This GitHub is a space where I share projects, experiments, and learning journeys as I grow as a data professional and refine my craft.

My work focuses on:

*End-to-end data analysis and problem solving

*Creating intuitive dashboards and visual stories

*Building efficient, reusable analytics workflows

*Applying data thinking to real-world problems
